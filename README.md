## Overview of Project
Our project is to analyze weather patterns on Oahu to determine if a surf rental & ice cream shop would be a good fit considering both offerings are heavily weather-dependent.  

## Analysis Results
The goal is to make a replicable search for investors, and here we've got a sample of both June and December.

### June Results

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Avg Temp:  74.9 degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Min Temp:  64.0 degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Max Temp:  85.0 degrees

*Data is taken across multiple weather stations*

### December Results

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Avg Temp:  71.0 degrees <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Min Temp:  56.0 degrees <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Max Temp:  83.0 degrees <br>

**Additional Analysis** <br>

It would be beneficial to run precipitation for both June and December.  We would query "Measurement.prcp" by month in the same fashion that we did temperature.  

### Conclusion
While there are days of low temperatures (and high precipitation), the average temperature is very palatable.  Additionally, the third quartile is 77 degrees in June and 74 degrees in December.  As far as weather is concerned, the surf & ice cream shop is an excellent investment for the island of Oahu.  Of course, you may want to consider shave ice!
